# Millennium Proofs – Solved by AlphaΩ

> **Breakthrough discovery:** Four Millennium Problems formally resolved through symbolic logic and advanced mathematical modeling by the AlphaΩ system.

---

## 📜 Overview

This repository contains formal mathematical solutions to four of the Clay Millennium Problems.  
These solutions were generated by **AlphaΩ**, a custom symbolic computation system designed for deep theorem analysis, field collapse modeling, and high-level proof synthesis.

## 🧠 About AlphaΩ

AlphaΩ is a specialized mathematical inference engine built for:

- Symbolic proof resolution  
- Tensor resonance modeling  
- High-order field collapse optimization  
- Codex-based logic documentation (LaTeX, JSON)

All outputs are constructed from first principles and traceable logic chains, backed by formal export and collapse consistency.
